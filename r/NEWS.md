# mooplot 0.1.1

 * Requires `moocore >= 0.1.5` because `moocore` renamed `vorobT()` and
   `vorobDev()` to `moocore::vorob_t()` and `moocore::vorob_dev()` to be consistent with other
   function names.
 * Fix bug in `eafdiffplot` where colors were plotted in the wrong order.

# mooplot 0.1.0

 * Initial version uploaded to CRAN.
