This reference manual details functions, modules, and objects
included in mooplot, describing what they are and what they do.
For learning how to use mooplot, see the :ref:`complete documentation <mooplot_docs_mainpage>`.

Functions docstrings are presented, grouped by functionality.
Many docstrings contain example code, which demonstrates basic usage
of the function. The examples assume that mooplot and moocore are imported with::

  >>> import moocore
  >>> import mooplot

A convenient way to execute examples is the ``%doctest_mode`` mode of
IPython, which allows for pasting of multi-line examples and preserves
indentation.
