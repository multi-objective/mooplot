  abstract = {This chapter introduces two Perl programs that
                  implement graphical tools for exploring the
                  performance of stochastic local search algorithms
                  for biobjective optimization problems. These tools
                  are based on the concept of the empirical attainment
                  function (EAF), which describes the probabilistic
                  distribution of the outcomes obtained by a
                  stochastic algorithm in the objective space. In
                  particular, we consider the visualization of
                  attainment surfaces and differences between the
                  first-order EAFs of the outcomes of two
                  algorithms. This visualization allows us to identify
                  certain algorithmic behaviors in a graphical way.
                  We explain the use of these visualization tools and
                  illustrate them with examples arising from
                  practice.}
